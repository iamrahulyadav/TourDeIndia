# TourDeIndia
Tourist Info App

TourDeIndia is a tourist info app which shows a list of various Indian cities along with an image and city description. Each city has associated with it an image gallery where the user can see a few images of the city. A separate tab shows a list of famous places in the city which attracts tourists from all over the world. User can also see the location of these places on GOOGLE MAPS.

As an option, user can also add his/her own city to the app along with city description and an image from either the camera or the internal storage. These cities are stored in database and and can be accessed by the user each time user opens the app. User can also delete newly added cities, however, default cities in the app cannot be deleted.

Since, this is a test app, all the city images are stored in internal storage. Here is the drive lnk of the folder. This folder needs to be copied to internal storage. Ensure the path of the folder is /storage/emulated/0/TourDeIndia. Else change the value of INTERNAL_STORAGE_DATA_FOLDER in .utils.Constants in the project as the path of the folder.
